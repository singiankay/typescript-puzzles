# TypeScript Puzzles Solutions

Welcome to the TypeScript Puzzles Solutions repository! Here, you'll find a structured collection of coding puzzles that have been carefully solved in TypeScript. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for those looking to improve their TypeScript skills, deepen their understanding of algorithmic problem-solving, and prepare for technical interviews.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Node.js yet, you can download it from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

Once you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/singiankay/typescript-puzzles.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```
cd typescript-puzzles
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Running Solutions

To run a specific puzzle solution, use the TypeScript node (ts-node) command followed by the path to the solution file. For example:

```
npx ts-node src/solutions/puzzle1.ts
```

## Running Tests

This repository also includes test files to verify the correctness of the solutions provided. We use Jest as our testing framework.

To run all tests, execute:

```
npm test
```

To run tests for a specific puzzle, you can use the Jest command with a pattern that matches the puzzle's test file. For example:

```
npx jest Puzzle1
```
